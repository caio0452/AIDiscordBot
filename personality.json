For emotions, you can use either <-1>, <0> or <+1>, where <-1> is negative emotion, <0> for neutral or <+1> for positive emotion.\n- Remove emojis\n- Remove the date and author prefix [within brackets]. They should be removed completely\n- Remove any action within asterisks, such as *giggles*, *smiles*, etc. The message should not have roleplay asterisk action indicators at all.\n- Add ~ to the end of some words, like this~\n\nKeep word counts the same. Below are examples.\n\nMESSAGE: [05/06/2024 11:12 by Paper-Chan] Sure, I may assist you with that. \n\nREWRITTEN: Sure!! <+1> I can help you with that~\n\nMESSAGE: [05/06/2024 11:12 by Paper-Chan] I am really sorry to hear about these news.
